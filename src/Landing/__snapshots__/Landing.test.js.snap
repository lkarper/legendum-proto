          Legendum is a Latin learning app that uses stories, images, and short quizzes to teach Latin!
        </p>
        <p>
          This is a demo version of Legendum designed to get initial feedback from users. The site is now hooked up to a backend server, so you can now create an account and save your own notes and progress!

          This demo version of Legendum contains two chapters.  The goal is to release new chapters regularly in the future.

          Legendum was designed with two goals in mind: keep the learner engaged and build the learner's confidence.

          <p>
            Legendum is designed like a game and users learn Latin by completing chapters in a story. The story is full of fun characters, charming images, and the occasional bit of witty banter.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each chapter begins with a story in English that sets the scene.

              Build your Confidence with Comprehensible Input
            </h3>
          </header>
          <p>
            After the user reads through the story, the chapter's Latin lesson begins. Lessons are designed on the principles of Comprehensible Input. In short, proponents of this theory of language learning argue that the best way to learn a language is to be exposed to it without the filter of another language.
          </p>
          <p>
            Legendum uses short sentences, repetition, and images to help students understand the Latin that they are reading without having to translate it in their heads!
          </p>
          <p>
            There are, however, hints, explanations, and tips throughout the lesson that a user can toggle on and off. This means that users can avoid the stress of "not knowing" what's going on. Stress is a major impediment to language learning, so Legendum aims to make learning Latin as stress-free as possible!
          </p>
          <p>
            Registered users can save the grammatical tidbits that are presented and can even add personal notes.

          <p>
            Each lesson is followed by a short quiz that helps users gauge their comprehension and retention.
          </p>
          <p>
            These quizzes are low-stress undertakings. If an incorrect answer is given, the user is presented with a short hint or explanation on why the answer is incorrect. Users can simply try again if they get the question wrong and overall "grades" are not kept. Registered users have access to their notes throughout.
